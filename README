Installation instructions tested on the Oracle Developer VM
(DeveloperDaysVM2017-03-02_12.ova):

Make sure that the MMDB folder resides in /home/oracle so that this
README file is located at /home/oracle/MMDB/README

First try to run the fully automated install script by opening
a terminal in the MMDB directory:

cd /home/oracle/MMDB
chmod a+x ./install_and_run.sh
./install_and_run.sh

Once this script is finished you can open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:12345

However, if this fails for some reason you can try the step-by-step guide from below, maybe
you have to change some settings regarding your specific database configuration.

In the Oracle Developer VM there are two database users you are going to need:

Username: SYSTEM
Password: oracle

Username: HR
Password: oracle

Compile with Oracle dependencies:
javac -cp "./lib/oracle/*" LuceneIndexer.java StoredContext.java

Load classes into the database with password "oracle":
loadjava -user HR/oracle StoredContext.class LuceneIndexer.class 

Compile LuceneIndexerWrapper with LIRE dependencies:
javac -cp "./lib/lire/*" LuceneIndexerWrapper.java

You can use the GUI tool Oracle SQL Developer to execute the following SQL commands.
Execute admin.sql as SYSTEM user
Execute setup.sql as HR user

Upload corel10k to database and create index afterwards:
javac -cp "./lib/oracle/*" UploadCorel.java
java -cp ".:./lib/oracle/*" UploadCorel

When the upload is complete, this will also create the index, which may take a couple
of minutes.

Compile and run the front end, this will launch a webserver on port 12345
javac -cp "./lib/frontend/*:./lib/oracle/ojdbc8_g.jar" FrontEnd.java
java -cp ".:./lib/frontend/*:./lib/oracle/ojdbc8_g.jar" FrontEnd 12345

Use your browser to navigate to http://localhost:12345
